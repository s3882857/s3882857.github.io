      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Cultural background and heritage have never been of interest to me. So I don't have much to offer on this. I was born in the customary way... and that's it.</p>
        <p>My main interests and hobbies have always been exercise, science, technology, weight-lifting, and cooking. Give me a good documentary relating to one of these and I'm watching. I know I can hear you now, that sounds really boring, but I love it! Healthy living and exercise has always been my 'Rock' and I hope always will be . I work-out whenever possible. And with that, every avid gym enthusiast comes, a budding cook.</p>
        <p>I love to cook. The more knowledge acquired from exercise and working out, the more I have realised how important life style, health, and tasty foods keep you going. I do not drink and I have never smoked. Longevity. I intend to be around for as long as possible. I can envision a time when people life forever. Beyond that, science and technology have become my intellectual passions.</p>
        <p>I have always been obsessed with science and technology. It started in my adolescents, I was obsessed with arcade games. At about 10 years old, I discovered, “Space Invaders”. Back then, it was the biggest craze, regarded as the one that started the gaming phenomenon we all know today. My parents quickly encouraged this obsession, which led me to my first computer, the 'Commodore 64'. My Sisters, then partner, was a Computer Programmer, every time he would visit my parents house, he would teach me something new in programming. I began 'coding' at an early age.  </p>
        <p>However, things do not always work out the way you think. After a lack of lustre, or underachieving finish to my High School year, I found myself working in a dull job (A bank) and destined to never fulfil my dreams. Eventually... I got my act together and completed an Advanced Diploma in IT in 1998.</p>
        <p>This got me a start, I worked as a programmer in older style languages, namely PIC and BBX. Along the way I was able to gain some expertise in languages such as Java and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>It lasted around 14-15 years. Then for various reasons, I found myself out of the industry and unable to re-enter. Personal issues conquered. I completed several short courses online and gradually rebuilt my confidence which led 'Open Universities'. I have finally realised a Degree is what I really wanted and have needed.</p>
        <p>The original dream has never left me. I've rediscovered that passion which drove me back then in the 80s. I'd still love to build and write games. If that turns out to be a far-fetched dream, I know there is still something out there that I can do in the programming IT space.</p>
        <p>Speaking of Space, The future of space exploration. Humanity is witnessing an inflection point in this industry. How far can humanity go?  A new quest; To improve; To strive for something better. The endeavour will bring enormous benefit to the world. Information Technology I think, has been the driving force. Software Development, Artificial Intelligence, in particular, has reduced costs and brought new life to the industry. No longer the realm of Science Fiction, but a living reality.</p>
        <p>I think, this is where the most exciting jobs will be. Big Cheer to Elon Musk. My personal hero, at the moment.</p>
        <p>And so... getting back to the boring part. I was born in Sandringham hospital in Victoria. I've spent the majority of my life living in Cheltenham, Victoria. I am non-religious. I have never been interested in cultural type accomplishments. I will say, that my family originally came from South Australia. And that is, as mush as I know about that.</p>
