            <p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51730520?type=standout#searchRequestToken=0cf3d9c6-baa1-49ac-862d-17f7185fa0fb">Seek - Scientific Python Programmer</a></p>

            <p>I think, there are a number of possible positions available here as the number of locations are all over Australia. The possibility, of lower level entry positions may exist, other than the specific job mentioned. Obtaining a role in this area would be a goal for me on its own.</p>
            <p>Essentially the role is highly complex. As stated an understanding of, “scientific workflows”, which means creating programs to predict, interpret, and analyse scientific processes.  This is a little vague. Applying would lead to a more specific comprehension.</p>
            <p>This job appeals to me mainly for the mentioning of the programming language Python. Not to mention the word 'Scientific'. Reading further, “Experience/Knowledge of processing satellite Earth Observation data.”, now that sparked interest. It fits with my interests and profile above. This type of job sounds fascinating to me, the area of science based computer usage is an area I would like to pursue. Not to mention the salary, job security, etc looks and sounds nice too.</p>
            <p>The level of technical expertise is high and specific, however I still think it is worth applying, like any job advertisement, the possibility of other positions may exist. I think applying, in itself, could lead to a lesser position within the area, which could place me on a learning path to a similar position in the future. I attribute this rationalisation as it is a government position with a specific nature, that would require considerable internal training paths for mployees. I am making an assumption here, however I think it is justifiable on the grounds that there is nothing to loose by applying. There is no way to know for sure and nothing to loose otherwise. Part of the training process would be to obtain a role here to begin with. In the meantime, developing my skills, here at Uni is paramount.</p>
            <p>I think, I need to develop my programming skills particularly in Python, I do have skills in Java, which is actually a little more complex than Python, so I'm not intimidated by this. I already have industry experience as a computer programmer and tester, document writer, etc.</p>
            <p>Again, continuing to study is obviously paramount to achieving this goal.</p>

            <p>I am a little undecided on the above job, so I'm going to include a second. You can ignore this, however, I do not want anybody else whom may read this, to think that I am not interested in Game Development roles.</p>
            <p>The role is obviously for Game Developer involving C++, and C# experience. I already have some experience in both these languages, as far as Short Courses can take you. Again, further study into these languages and all languages is needed. There are multiple game development platforms out there that I need to understand better. The Job Advertisement mentions Unreal/Unity experience as optional, but I think this is an area I need to also pursue.</p>
            <p>A good story on these 2 platforms is included here in this link : <a href="https://www.gamedesigning.org/engines/unity-vs-unreal/">Unity vs Unreal</a></p>
