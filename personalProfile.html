            <p>Personality cannot be defined in constant terms; Personality is ever changing. External influences, affecting mood, life circumstances, our peers, they all have a greater effect on how we behave in a group. You cannot define something that is in a continual state of change. I took the test several times and got several different results. My general mood, confidences, etc can play a part, especially if you experiment with the tests over period of time. I waited a few days before repeating the test and got different results. I have retained the ones that I liked the most.</p>
            <p>Which, brings me to the point that what we answer could be more dependant on what we perceive ourselves to be rather than what we are. What we want to believe about ourselves rather than who we actually are. I think this type of categorisation works for the companies that utilise them, but not for the individual. People are more inclined to manipulate their own profile to suit what they believe the company is looking for.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, personality tests should be taken with a 'grain of salt'. Very few of them are actually based in science. I would equate most of them to belonging to the category 'pseudoscience'. Our behaviour and personalities are effected more by our surroundings than anything internalised. The individual in the team will be influenced by the other team members. Whether introvert or extrovert will depend more on an individuals surroundings than what they take with them.</p>
            <p>These tests should not be taken into account at all when forming a team. They are largely based on falsehoods and assumptions. There history is based on one single persons take on what they think personality is. Having any preconceived ideas about your team members prior to working with them in a team will not give you any real insight into how they will actually perform in the team. In the end, the only way to know how a person will behave in a particular team will depend more on their 'Team-Building skills more than their personality. The proof is in the pudding.</p>
