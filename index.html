          <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Cultural background and heritage have never been of interest to me. So I don't have much to offer on this. I was born in the customary way... and that's it.</p>
            <p>My main interests and hobbies have always been exercise, science, technology, weight-lifting, and cooking. Give me a good documentary relating to one of these and I'm watching. I know I can hear you now, that sounds really boring, but I love it! Healthy living and exercise has always been my 'Rock' and I hope always will be . I work-out whenever possible. And with that, every avid gym enthusiast comes, a budding cook.</p>
            <p>I love to cook. The more knowledge acquired from exercise and working out, the more I have realised how important life style, health, and tasty foods keep you going. I do not drink and I have never smoked. Longevity. I intend to be around for as long as possible. I can envision a time when people life forever. Beyond that, science and technology have become my intellectual passions.</p>
            <p>I have always been obsessed with science and technology. It started in my adolescents, I was obsessed with arcade games. At about 10 years old, I discovered, “Space Invaders”. Back then, it was the biggest craze, regarded as the one that started the gaming phenomenon we all know today. My parents quickly encouraged this obsession, which led me to my first computer, the 'Commodore 64'. My Sisters, then partner, was a Computer Programmer, every time he would visit my parents house, he would teach me something new in programming. I began 'coding' at an early age.  </p>
            <p>However, things do not always work out the way you think. After a lack of lustre, or underachieving finish to my High School year, I found myself working in a dull job (A bank) and destined to never fulfil my dreams. Eventually... I got my act together and completed an Advanced Diploma in IT in 1998.</p>
            <p>This got me a start, I worked as a programmer in older style languages, namely PIC and BBX. Along the way I was able to gain some expertise in languages such as Java and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>It lasted around 14-15 years. Then for various reasons, I found myself out of the industry and unable to re-enter. Personal issues conquered. I completed several short courses online and gradually rebuilt my confidence which led 'Open Universities'. I have finally realised a Degree is what I really wanted and have needed.</p>
            <p>The original dream has never left me. I've rediscovered that passion which drove me back then in the 80s. I'd still love to build and write games. If that turns out to be a far-fetched dream, I know there is still something out there that I can do in the programming IT space.</p>
            <p>Speaking of Space, The future of space exploration. Humanity is witnessing an inflection point in this industry. How far can humanity go?  A new quest; To improve; To strive for something better. The endeavour will bring enormous benefit to the world. Information Technology I think, has been the driving force. Software Development, Artificial Intelligence, in particular, has reduced costs and brought new life to the industry. No longer the realm of Science Fiction, but a living reality.</p>
            <p>I think, this is where the most exciting jobs will be. Big Cheer to Elon Musk. My personal hero, at the moment.</p>
            <p>And so... getting back to the boring part. I was born in Sandringham hospital in Victoria. I've spent the majority of my life living in Cheltenham, Victoria. I am non-religious. I have never been interested in cultural type accomplishments. I will say, that my family originally came from South Australia. And that is, as mush as I know about that.</p>

          <h4 class="headings" id="IdealJob">Ideal Job</h2>

          <div>

            <p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51730520?type=standout#searchRequestToken=0cf3d9c6-baa1-49ac-862d-17f7185fa0fb">Seek - Scientific Python Programmer</a></p>

            <p>I think, there are a number of possible positions available here as the number of locations are all over Australia. The possibility, of lower level entry positions may exist, other than the specific job mentioned. Obtaining a role in this area would be a goal for me on its own.</p>
            <p>Essentially the role is highly complex. As stated an understanding of, “scientific workflows”, which means creating programs to predict, interpret, and analyse scientific processes.  This is a little vague. Applying would lead to a more specific comprehension.</p>
            <p>This job appeals to me mainly for the mentioning of the programming language Python. Not to mention the word 'Scientific'. Reading further, “Experience/Knowledge of processing satellite Earth Observation data.”, now that sparked interest. It fits with my interests and profile above. This type of job sounds fascinating to me, the area of science based computer usage is an area I would like to pursue. Not to mention the salary, job security, etc looks and sounds nice too.</p>
            <p>The level of technical expertise is high and specific, however I still think it is worth applying, like any job advertisement, the possibility of other positions may exist. I think applying, in itself, could lead to a lesser position within the area, which could place me on a learning path to a similar position in the future. I attribute this rationalisation as it is a government position with a specific nature, that would require considerable internal training paths for mployees. I am making an assumption here, however I think it is justifiable on the grounds that there is nothing to loose by applying. There is no way to know for sure and nothing to loose otherwise. Part of the training process would be to obtain a role here to begin with. In the meantime, developing my skills, here at Uni is paramount.</p>
            <p>I think, I need to develop my programming skills particularly in Python, I do have skills in Java, which is actually a little more complex than Python, so I'm not intimidated by this. I already have industry experience as a computer programmer and tester, document writer, etc.</p>
            <p>Again, continuing to study is obviously paramount to achieving this goal.</p>

            <p>I am a little undecided on the above job, so I'm going to include a second. You can ignore this, however, I do not want anybody else whom may read this, to think that I am not interested in Game Development roles.</p>
            <p>The role is obviously for Game Developer involving C++, and C# experience. I already have some experience in both these languages, as far as Short Courses can take you. Again, further study into these languages and all languages is needed. There are multiple game development platforms out there that I need to understand better. The Job Advertisement mentions Unreal/Unity experience as optional, but I think this is an area I need to also pursue.</p>
            <p>A good story on these 2 platforms is included here in this link : <a href="https://www.gamedesigning.org/engines/unity-vs-unreal/">Unity vs Unreal</a></p>

              <p>Personality cannot be defined in constant terms; Personality is ever changing. External influences, affecting mood, life circumstances, our peers, they all have a greater effect on how we behave in a group. You cannot define something that is in a continual state of change. I took the test several times and got several different results. My general mood, confidences, etc can play a part, especially if you experiment with the tests over period of time. I waited a few days before repeating the test and got different results. I have retained the ones that I liked the most.</p>
              <p>Which, brings me to the point that what we answer could be more dependant on what we perceive ourselves to be rather than what we are. What we want to believe about ourselves rather than who we actually are. I think this type of categorisation works for the companies that utilise them, but not for the individual. People are more inclined to manipulate their own profile to suit what they believe the company is looking for.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, personality tests should be taken with a 'grain of salt'. Very few of them are actually based in science. I would equate most of them to belonging to the category 'pseudoscience'. Our behaviour and personalities are effected more by our surroundings than anything internalised. The individual in the team will be influenced by the other team members. Whether introvert or extrovert will depend more on an individuals surroundings than what they take with them.</p>
              <p>These tests should not be taken into account at all when forming a team. They are largely based on falsehoods and assumptions. There history is based on one single persons take on what they think personality is. Having any preconceived ideas about your team members prior to working with them in a team will not give you any real insight into how they will actually perform in the team. In the end, the only way to know how a person will behave in a particular team will depend more on their 'Team-Building skills more than their personality. The proof is in the pudding.</p>

            <h5 class="headings">Studio Gym</h5>
            <h6 class="headings">Overview</h6>

            <div>
              <p>A mobile phone application together with a web page to create and store statistical information concerning a persons workout routine. Currently there are many professional looking applications out there that already cater to this market.</p>
              <p>However, none provide much information on understanding how much a given workout is actually providing. Much of the focus is on giving the user preset workouts, lots of fancy videos on how to perform the said exercises. Little emphasis is placed on the interpretation of the data collected. There are many heart monitors and distance tracking tools, but none provide much beyond basic, time taken, sets, reps, distance travelled etc.</p>
              <p>Therefore, this would be a Personal training application to store client workout information and provide a more comprehensive analyse of the data produced. The analysis will provide an understanding of the muscle groups the client is focusing on and to what extend they are being worked. Comparisons in the form of ratios will be produced to ascertain the level to which each muscle and the opposing muscle are being worked. This would be used to produce a ratio and from this a variance or difference.</p>
              <p>Personal trainers and or Physiotherapist could then use this data to ascertain the acceptable balance levels between muscles.</p>
            </div>

            <h6 class="headings">Motivation</h6>
            <div>
              <p>When I first started working out in a gym one of the single things that I wanted was an enormous chest and shoulders. Hence, like many prospective, male, gym enthusiasts, I would focus mainly on exercises, such as, Bench Press, Shoulder Press, and the occasional Bicep Curl or Beach Curl. This would usually result in very little exercise being performed on anything else.</p>
              <p>The negative aspects of this type of training would lead to injury. The under worked muscles, would become proportionately weaker, creating the  classic 'Hunchback look'. In extreme cases these imbalances can lead to serious tendon, ligament, and muscle damage.</p>
              <p>So, how do we determine when this is occurring and to what extent? And, more importantly how can it be avoided? Usually, a good Personal Trainer, or a Physiotherapist would be able to recognise the signs and direct the person appropriately.</p>
              <p>However, for most of us, this still does not register. Being able to produce quantifiable data and produce a graphical representation of a persons workout to highlight any imbalances between muscle groups would address this issue better.</p>
              <p><a href="https://coach.nine.com.au/fitness/the-dark-side-of-pecs/963da893-d085-4ba6-a3d5-603be20c3e6d"></a></p>
            </div>

            <h6 class="headings">Detailed Description</h6>

            <div>
              <p>If I perform a Bicep Curl exercise using a Dumbbell weighing 30Kg. It is said, that I have performed, one repetition, or 30Kg's of work on my bicep muscle. Taking this further, and repeating it ten times, would result in 10 Repetitions at 30Kg's. Thus, having performed 300Kg's of work (10 Reps * 30Kgs).  If I then perform the opposing exercise, a Tricep Extension, and performed the same number of repetitions at the same weight as the Bicep Curl. I have then, also performed 300Kg's of work, but on my triceps.</p>
              <p>The bicep has performed 300Kgs of work and the Tricep has also performed 300Kgs of work, a ratio can be drawn of 300/300 between the two opposing muscles. </p>
              <p>Many such opposing muscle groups exist in the human body and all can be analysed in this way, creating many ratios, to produce an overall understanding of how well balanced a given workout is progressing. </p>
              <p>In order to do this an understanding of the muscles involved in each exercise is required. This will require a setup process to create muscle names. The level of detail here can be varied.
See table 1. Muscle Codes.</p>

            <p>From here a percentage of the work done for each exercise can be calculated as a percentage of the total work done.</p>
            <p>The main objective can then be achieved by creating a setup to match a muscle to its opposing muscle. A ratio can be produced as well as a variance based on this ratio. As can be seen the Variance between biceps and triceps is quite large indicating the person has been focusing on triceps more than their biceps. The variance between Middle Pectoral muscles and the Latissimus Dorsi is also large. Indicating the chest muscles have been over worked in relation to the back muscles.</p>

            <p>There are a number of programming languages that could be used to create a mobile application for this project as well as a web page.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Python</li>
              <li>Swift</li>
              <li>JavaScript</li>
              <li>Rust</li>
              <li>Scala</li>
              <li>Ruby</li>
              <li>GoLang/Go</li>
              <li>Java</li>
            </ul>

            <p>My skills are limited in these at the moment. However, I do have a degree of understanding in general programming. It's a matter of building up from here. At the moment obtaining the skills myself will take some time. The length of my Degree if required. Exact details would only be approximations. However, there are plenty of people with skills in all of these languages. I wish to do this myself as a learning experience, more so than an actual commercial application.</p>
            <p>I would suggest the use of GitHub, Notepad++, atom.io, eclipse or visual studio as the development tools. No hardware requirements. Other than the web page hosting service, which GitHub is.</p>

          <h6 class="headings">Outcome</h6>

          <div>
            <p>I do not expect to replace the current exercise programs out in the market place. However, this should be viewed as a step towards a singularly, more complex, method of analysing workout data than what is currently available.</p>
            <p>Bearing this in mind, the people most likely to begin uptake of such a product would need to be Personal Trainers with a reasonable understanding of the technicalities and complexities involved. It would require a person whom has the patience and enthusiasm to want to work with myself and others to build such an interface.</p>
            <p>This is not for the average gym attendee at first.</p>
            <p>I view this more as an exercise to demonstrate and learn the skills required to build such a project. I selected this as it would require a fairly high level of complexity, with and containing a logical continuity that would facilitate an ever growing exercise orientated application. In short, something challenging.</p>
            <p>I am also concerned about potential problems, in particular, this could lead to litigation if somebody claims that this future product caused an injury. I am not sure of all the complexities here. What my obligations would be and duty of care to a user would be. This is potentially a reason to avoid proceeding into the market place with such a product.</p>
            <p>Note : I would prefer to build a game that is pretty much the same as every other game out there. I would love to be a game developer. I see this project as a way to learn and develop something complicated to meet that end, which ever that happens to be.</p>
